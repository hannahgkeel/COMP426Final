# A brief description of the project
COVID-19 calls for companies to adapt and take extra safety precautions for customers and employees. At Monterrey's there can be overcrowding in peak times while customers are waiting to be seated. Customers are unable to social distance themselves putting everyone at risk. Our solution is a virtual waiting list customers can join without entering the restaurant until their table is ready.

# Customer tutorial:
A customer will first go to www.monterreywaitlist.xyz where they will see the home page with three simple step listed. The customer will first register or login. After loging in, the customer will be taken to a page that asks them to select the monterrey location and party size they will have. Next they are taken to the in list page which displays a progress bar so the customers can see how many people are ahead of them. This page also has directions to the restaurant as well as information about the restaurant. On this page the customer has the option to leave the waitlist. When their table is ready, the customer will see a table ready page that gives them a few social distancing guidlines and tells them they have 10 minutes to meet the host at the host stand and claim their table.
